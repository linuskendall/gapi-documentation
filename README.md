# Gigenet API documentation

This is the api documentation for Gigenet. It is built on top of Slate. The slate documentation can be found [README.slate.md](here).

The actual documentation of the API calls is autogenerated through this endpoint `/index.php?act=api&do=v2_md`. This will generate
a markdown document describing all our API calls. To update the static version in this repo, simply paste this file into
`source/includes/_api.md` replacing the existing content. Then deploy according to the standard slate instructions.
