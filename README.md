# Gigenet API documentation

This is the api documentation for Gigenet. It is built on top of Slate. The slate documentation can be found in [README.slate.md].

The actual documentation of the API calls is autogenerated through this endpoint `/index.php?act=api&do=v2_md`. This will generate
a markdown document describing all our API calls. To update the static version in this repo, simply paste this file into
`source/includes/_api.md` replacing the existing content. Then deploy according to the standard slate instructions.

You can run a local live updating copy of this documentation through `bundle exec middleman server`. See the slate docs for details on dependencies.

The static version of the documentation is generated into the `gh-pages` branch. Access this branch anytime to download the API docs. To regenerate the contents of this branch run the `deploy.sh` script in this directory.
